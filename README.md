# Loan Approval Prediction - CatBoost + EDA + Optuna

## Overview

This project aims to predict loan approval using **CatBoost** combined with **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** and **Optuna** for hyperparameter tuning. The dataset is highly imbalanced, and **SMOTE** was used to balance the classes. **CatBoost** was chosen due to its ability to handle categorical features efficiently, without requiring extensive preprocessing.

The final model achieves strong performance in terms of both precision and recall, even for the minority class.

## Model Results

The model achieved a high **Accuracy Score** of **0.948**, with a **ROC-AUC Score** of **0.968**, which shows the model's excellent ability to distinguish between the two classes. Precision and recall scores for both classes are strong, with the model doing particularly well on the majority class, and still maintaining good performance on the minority class (loan approvals).
